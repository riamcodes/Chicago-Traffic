# Data Analysis and Visualization with Jupyter Notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis and visualization tasks. The original notebook was split into two parts to make the content more accessible and manageable for GitHub. Each part contains the same insightful data analysis and visualizations without rerunning the code.

## Files

- `Untitled_Part1.ipynb`: The first half of the analysis, covering initial data exploration and early visualizations.
- `Untitled_Part2.ipynb`: The second half of the analysis, including advanced visualizations and insights based on the processed data.
- `DEDITED.ipynb`: Another Jupyter Notebook file for additional analysis (if necessary).

## Features

- **Data Exploration**: Step-by-step exploration of the dataset, with data cleaning, preprocessing, and preliminary analysis.
- **Visualizations**: Various charts and graphs created using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to represent data trends and insights.
- **Efficient Notebook Splitting**: The large original notebook was split into multiple parts while maintaining all output graphs for better GitHub compatibility.

## How to View

The notebooks contain all graphs and visualizations in their saved outputs. To view the analysis:
1. Open `Untitled_Part1.ipynb` and `Untitled_Part2.ipynb` directly on GitHub or in Jupyter Notebook without rerunning the code.
2. If you'd like to modify or rerun the code, make sure the following Python libraries are installed:
   - pandas
   - matplotlib
   - seaborn
   - numpy

To install these dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
